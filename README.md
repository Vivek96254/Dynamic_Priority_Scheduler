# Dynamic_Priority_Scheduler

Consider a scheduling approach which is non pre-emptive similar to shortest job next in 
nature. The priority of each job is dependent on its estimated run time, and also the amount of 
time it has spent waiting. Jobs gain higher priority the longer they wait, which prevents 
indefinite postponement. The jobs that have spent a long time waiting compete against those 
estimated to have short run times. The priority can be computed as :
Priority = 1+ Waiting time / Estimated run time
Write a program to implement such an algorithm. Ensure
1. The input is given dynamically at run time by the user
2. The priority of each process is visible after each unit of time
3. The gantt chart is shown as an output
4. Calculate individual waiting time and average waiting time
